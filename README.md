# M1-W3-D3-Homework: Simple Calculator for Mathematical Operations

This repository contains a simple calculator project developed during the **Front End Web Development Bootcamp (M1-W3-D3-Homework)**. The calculator allows users to perform various mathematical operations, such as squaring a number, halving a number, calculating percentages, rounding to the nearest integer, and calculating the area of a circle.

_First Updated: July 23, 2021_

## Features

- **Square a Number:** Users can input a number and calculate its square.
- **Half a Number:** Users can input a number and calculate its half.
- **Percentage Calculation:** Users can input two numbers (fraction and whole) and calculate the percentage.
- **Integer Operation:** Users can input a number and calculate its nearest whole number.
- **Area of a Circle:** Users can input the radius of a circle and calculate its area.
- **Live Solution Display:** The solution to each operation is displayed dynamically on the web page.

## HTML Structure

The project includes the following HTML structure:
- Multiple sections for each operation with input fields and buttons to trigger the calculations.
- A dedicated section to display the solution.

### Sections:
1. **Square a Number**
2. **Half a Number**
3. **Calculate Percentage**
4. **Integer Operations**
5. **Calculate Area of Circle**
6. **Solution Section**

## JavaScript Operations

The JavaScript file (`math-operations.js`) handles the following:
- Squaring a number
- Halving a number
- Calculating percentage
- Rounding to the nearest integer
- Calculating the area of a circle
- Updating the solution dynamically on the web page
